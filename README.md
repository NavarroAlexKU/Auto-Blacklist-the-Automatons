## Project Walk-Through:

1.) We will start by implementing the AWS WAF and create a web ACL

### What is AWS WAF?
* AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you montior the HTTP & HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon Cloudfront or application load balancer. This AWS service operates at the Application layer (layer 7) of the OSI model.

    a.) go to the AWS Management Console and Search AWS WAF or go to "Security, Indentity, & Compliance" and you can find the service there.

    You'll then be brought to AWS WAF homepage, click "Create web ACL"

* Next you will see theh following Steps listed to the left-hand side of your screen:
    - Describe web ACL and associate it to AWS resources
    - Add Rules and rule groups
    - Set rule priority
    - Configure metrics
    - Review and create web ACl

    I'm going to name the web ACL "ACG_Resistant_ACL" then click proceed to step 2.

    Now we're on the "Add rule and rule groups":
        * for now all we will do is make sure that we set "Default web ACL action for requests that don't match any rules" to "Allow"
